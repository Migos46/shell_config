# README 
- This project is a starting point for new `shell` users in zsh, where usually the user interface is pretty **boring** compare with the default bash in `ubuntu` for instance.
## Environment 
- ***`OS:`*** `macOS Monterrey`
- ***`Shell:`*** `/bin/zsh` 
## Shell config file  
The config file has comments that helps to understand the first basic steps to make the `zsh shell`looks beautiful.  
Currently, the config file just has the basics to change a bit the PS1 variable and color it.  
- [Color palette numbers can be found in this link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Xterm_256color_chart.svg)  

Also, the file has added what I found to colour the output of the `grep`command and, to enable autocompletion when using `git`.  
  
***Hope you enjoy it***
